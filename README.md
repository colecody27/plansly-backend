## 💡 Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a lightweight, collaborative web application for users to organize events. This is similar to Partiful but with buy-in functionality. This gives the organizer confidence in the attendance and appropriated funds. 

An organizer will be able to create different types of plans, such as a trip, event, or group purchase. Once created, the organizer can invite participants through a link. Depending on the type of plan, participants will have different abilities. Every plan will include the following: deadline, total cost, cost per person, list of participants, organizer, a chat, and status. 

### Trip
If the type of plan is a trip, these participants will have the ability to propose and vote for new events. Each trip will have a deadline and once reached, the event will be locked. Participants must make sure to pay before this deadline in order to be considered “going”. 

### Event/Group Purchase
This includes all of the functionality of a Trip, except without collaboration. Participants will not be able to propose edits.
